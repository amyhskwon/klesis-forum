# Klesis Forum

## Description

Klesis Forum is a community forum for UC Berkeley SRO called Klesis, and its main purpose is for members to post events, join and communicate with their interest-based groups, and make announcements. Non-members can also have access to basic information of events and interest groups.

## Usage

After creating an account and logging in, you will be able to join interest groups and RSVP for events. You'll see the interest groups and events you signed up for on your profile page. You will also be able to chat with different members who are part of the same interest group.

If you are assigned as a moderator of a group, you can delete messages and kick a member off an interest group.

If you are an admin, you can create events, interest groups, and also delete a whole interest group.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback.

I hope you enjoy using Klesis Forum! ðŸ˜Š
